  abstract={Machine learning methods have been shown to be effective for weather forecasting, based on the speed and accuracy compared to traditional numerical models. While early efforts primarily concentrated on deterministic predictions, the field has increasingly shifted toward probabilistic forecasting to better capture the forecast uncertainty. Most machine learning-based models have been designed for global-scale predictions, with only limited work targeting regional or limited area forecasting, which allows more specialized and flexible modeling for specific locations. This work introduces Diffusion-LAM, a probabilistic limited area weather model leveraging conditional diffusion. By conditioning on boundary data from surrounding regions, our approach generates forecasts within a defined area. Experimental results on the MEPS limited area dataset demonstrate the potential of Diffusion-LAM to deliver accurate probabilistic forecasts, highlighting its promise for limited-area weather prediction.},

    abstract = {Neural weather models have shown immense potential as inexpensive and accurate alternatives to physics-based models. However, most models trained to perform weather forecasting do not quantify the uncertainty associated with their forecasts. This limits the trust in the model and the usefulness of the forecasts. In this work we construct and formalise a conformal prediction framework as a post-processing method for estimating this uncertainty. The method is model-agnostic and gives calibrated error bounds for all variables, lead times and spatial locations. No modifications are required to the model and the computational cost is negligible compared to model training. We demonstrate the usefulness of the conformal prediction framework on a limited area neural weather model for the Nordic region. We further explore the advantages of the framework for deterministic and probabilistic models.},

    abstract = {The rise of accurate machine learning methods for weather forecasting is creating radical new possibilities for modeling the atmosphere. In the time of climate change, having access to high-resolution forecasts from models like these is also becoming increasingly vital. While most existing Neural Weather Prediction (NeurWP) methods focus on global forecasting, an important question is how these techniques can be applied to limited area modeling. In this work we adapt the graph-based NeurWP approach to the limited area setting and propose a multi-scale hierarchical model extension. Our approach is validated by experiments with a local model for the Nordic region.},

    abstract = {We propose a temporal graph neural network model for graph-structured irregular time series. The model is designed to handle both irregular time steps and partial graph observations. This is achieved by introducing a time-continuous latent state in each node of the graph. The latent dynamics are defined using a state-dependent decay-mechanism. Observations in the graph neighborhood are taken into account by integrating graph neural network layers in both the state update and predictive model. Experiments on a traffic forecasting task validate the usefulness of both the graph structure and time-continuous dynamics in this setting.},
