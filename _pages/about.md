I am a post-doctoral fellow at the [ETH Zurich AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/) in Zurich, Switzerland.
My research focuses on machine learning for spatio-temporal modeling in general and applications to earth science in particular.
I am mentored by [Torsten Hoefler](https://htor.inf.ethz.ch/), [Siddhartha Mishra](https://camlab.ethz.ch/the-group/group-head.html), and [Benedikt Soja](https://space.igp.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.soja.html).
My fellowship is also supported by the [Swiss AI Initiative](https://www.swiss-ai.org/), where I contribute to the earth system modeling efforts.

I got my MSc and PhD in computer science from Linköping University, Sweden.
During my PhD I was at the Division of Statistics and Machine Learning, supervised by [Fredrik Lindsten](https://lindsten.netlify.app/).
My [PhD thesis](https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-215665) is titled "Modeling Spatio-Temporal Systems with Graph-based Machine Learning".
I am also an alumnus of the [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/) graduate school.

In my research I work with probabilistic machine learning methods for modeling data with spatial and temporal dependencies.
I am motivated by applications of machine learning to earth system modeling, such as weather forecasting and climate modeling.
Part of my research is in core machine learning method development, where unique challenges from earth science act as an underlying motivation.
These challenges include irregular observations, high-dimensional data, complex temporal dynamics and the need for accurate uncertainty estimates.
I also enjoy developing methods specifically for earth science applications, tailoring the machine learning methods using domain knowledge to solve relevant problems in new ways.

<!--
I got my masters's degree in computer science and engineering from Linköping University in 2020.
In 2018-2019 I spent a year as an exchange student at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
I grew up in Lindesberg, Sweden and currently live in Linköping.
I am an avid Linux user and a believer in free and open source software. Openness of ideas, culture and research is very important to me. -->
