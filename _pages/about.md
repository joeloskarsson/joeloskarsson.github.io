I am a PhD-student at the Division of Statistics and Machine Learning, Department of Computer and Information Science, Linköping University, Sweden.
My main supervisor is [Fredrik Lindsten](https://lindsten.netlify.app/) and co-supervisors [Per Sidén](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=0UomzRIAAAAJ), [Tomas Landelius](https://www.smhi.se/en/research/research-departments/meteorology/tomas-landelius-1.4817) and [Jose M. Peña](https://www.ida.liu.se/~jospe50/).
I am an affiliated PhD-student within the [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/) program.

In my research I work with probabilistic machine learning methods for modeling data with spatial and temporal dependencies.
I am motivated by applications of machine learning to earth system modeling, such as weather forecasting and climate modeling.
Part of my research is in core machine learning method development, where unique challenges from earth science act as an underlying motivation.
These challenges include irregular observations, high-dimensional data, complex temporal dynamics and the need for accurate uncertainty estimates.
I also enjoy developing methods specifically for earth science applications, tailoring the machine learning methods using domain knowledge to solve relevant problems in new ways.

I got my masters's degree in computer science and engineering from Linköping University in 2020.
In 2018-2019 I spent a year as an exchange student at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
<!--I grew up in Lindesberg, Sweden and currently live in Linköping.
I am an avid Linux user and a believer in free and open source software. Openness of ideas, culture and research is very important to me. -->

My CV is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joeloskarsson/CV/master/docs/CV.pdf).
