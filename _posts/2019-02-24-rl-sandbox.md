I have always found that one of the best ways to truly understand a concept is to implement it in code. So when I got a couple days off in between my exams and the spring semester I decided to revisit one of the most interesting topics I studied this fall, but never really had the time to dive deep into amidst term exams and project deadlines. That is the topic of reinforcement learning, or more specifically the [model-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-free_(reinforcement_learning)) approach of [Q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning).

This project is a small application written in Python 3 that simulates a gridworld environment and an agent that can be trained using Q-learning. All code can be found on [github](https://github.com/joeloskarsson/rl-gridworld). The environment and learning hyperparameters can be adjusted in the GUI. Training can be followed in real time as the agent moves around the environment. Once a good estimate of the Q-function has been learned an optimal policy w.r.t. the learned function can be used.

The GUI was written in [PyQt](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt), a library that I haven't worked with before. I have some bad experiences with python GUI libraries (read Tkinter), but I have to say that working with PyQt was really smooth. Qt is a powerful toolkit and PyQt has shown to be a quite accessible binding. I had a really easy time to get up and running and make the GUI look how I wanted, so PyQt will definitely be my go to Python GUI library for future projects.

My continued exploration of the area of reinforcement learning has led me more into deep RL. I found a great resource in Open Ai's "[Spinning Up in Deep RL](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/index.html)" that I look forward to explore.
