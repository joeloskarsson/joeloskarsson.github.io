I attended the ["Third Workshop on Machine Learning for Earth System Modelling"](https://cesoc.net/third-workshop-on-machine-learning-for-the-earth-system/) in Bonn, Germany.
This event is always very interesting, and this time around I had the pleasure to present together with Simon Adamov our [recent work on building machine learning limited area weather models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09340). Slides are available [here](/assets/pdf/slides_ml4esm_bonn_2025.pdf).
